# Introduction

Hi friends! This is a compilation of resources for computer science students at Georgia Tech who want to learn practical CS skills not taught in class. Sometimes the real struggle of learning something new is figuring out where to learn from. This guide is meant to help you with that!

# Your Attitude

A few things to remember when going through the resources in this guide:

1. It is hard.
2. You will figure it out.
3. When in doubt, phone a friend.

# Resources

The Internet is your best friend when it comes to finding answers to your questions. Chances are that if you're having trouble installing a package or getting some code to compile, you're not the first one. Google is always a good start and Stackoverflow.com is another great resource. If you're having trouble with a specific error, copy and paste the error into Google. If you're having trouble understanding code in general, look up an API or Google a tutorial on the language/program/package. More often than not, you're using an undefined variable or forgetting a semicolon somewhere.

Stay calm. You got this.

# Github for Dummies
## Vocab
- **git**
- **repo** - a repository (or repo) is a project tracked by git

## Useful Commands
- `git clone` This clones a repository to your own deskop.
- `git add .` This adds any changes you've made in the current directory to the final commit.
- `git commit -am 'message goes here'` This commits the changes you're making and also adds a message for your reference.
- `git push` This pushes your changes to Github updating the "cloud" version on your code.
- `git pull` This pulls any new changes from Github that other people may have pushed.

## What's actually happening?
The backing data structure of Github is a tree.
