# Your Attitude

A few things to remember when going through the resources in this guide:

- **1.** It is hard.
- **2.** You will figure it out.
- **3.** When in doubt, phone a friend.

#Resources

The Internet is your best friends when it comes to finding answers to your questions. Chances are that if you're having trouble installing a package or getting some code to compile, you're not the first one. Google is always a good start and Stackoverflow.com is another great resource. If you're having trouble with a specific error, copy and paste the error into Google. If you're having trouble understanding code in general, look up an API or Google a tutorial on the language/program/package. More often than not, you're using an undefined variable or forgetting a semicolon somewhere.'

# Github for Dummies

- **git** 
- **repo**
